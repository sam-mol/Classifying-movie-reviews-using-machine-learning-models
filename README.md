IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

The handwritten digits recognition with MNIST dataset is the “Hello World” problem in the fields of deep learning models. It is an amazing project to get started with in order to understand the fundamental processes involved in a typical deep learning model development.
Application of Convolutional Neural Network models to MNIST dataset was one of the first successful applications of deep neural networks to "real world" data. Here I implemented a neural network model using deep learning framework Keras. Keras is a go-to tool to build deep learning models. I also used Numpy and Matplotlib libraries from PyData ecosystem (Python for data science) to clean and visualize the data.

Here are the steps that comprised the project:

Download the data and split the data into training and testing sets.
Clean the data and transform the data into a format that can be accepted by a model.
Build a model.
Train the model using the training dataset and track the model’s performance.
Adjust hyperparameters if needed and train the model again.
Test the model on the test set.
Report the findings.
